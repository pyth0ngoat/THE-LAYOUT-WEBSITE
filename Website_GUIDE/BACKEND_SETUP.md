# Backend Setup — Google Apps Script (Code.gs)

This project uses a Google Sheet + Apps Script Web App as its backend for
coupons, cart logs, completed orders, and product reviews. The frontend
talks to it through `src/lib/gas.ts` using the URL in
`CONFIG.GAS_URL` (see `src/lib/catalog.ts`).

---

## 1. Create the Google Sheet

Create a new Google Sheet named e.g. **"The Layout — Backend"** with these
tabs and header rows (row 1). Header names must match exactly.

### Tab: `Coupons`
| code | percent | active |
|------|---------|--------|
| LAYOUT10 | 10 | TRUE |

- `code`: coupon code (case-insensitive on validate)
- `percent`: number, e.g. `10` for 10%
- `active`: `TRUE` or `FALSE`

**You don't need a row here for SPINPOLA / SPINLETTER / SPINSTICK.**
`validateCoupon` now falls back to the `Spin Config` tab (see §7) when a code
isn't found in `Coupons` — any active spin-wheel prize code is automatically
a valid 0%-off coupon, and the frontend grants the matching free item
(polaroid strip / letter / sticker pack) instead of a discount. Only add a
`Coupons` row for a code if you want it to give a real % discount (like
`LAYOUT10` or `SPIN10`).

### Tab: `Cart Logs`
| cartId | name | phone | email | address | cart | total | timestamp |

(Headers auto-created on first write; you can leave the sheet empty.)

### Tab: `Completed Orders`
| orderId | cartId | name | phone | email | address | cart | total | coupon | screenshotUrl | timestamp | invoiceUrl | paymentVerified | shippingLabel |

(Headers auto-created on first write.) `invoiceUrl` and `shippingLabel` are
Drive links to a generated PDF invoice and a generated PDF shipping label
respectively (see `generateInvoicePdf_`/`generateShippingLabelPdf_` in
`code.gs`) — either can read `ERROR: <message>` instead of a link if Drive
generation failed for that order; that never blocks the order row itself
from being written. `paymentVerified` defaults to `"Pending..."` — there's
no UI for it, whoever manages the sheet edits it by hand after verifying
payment.

### Tab: `Reviews`
| id | productId | name | rating | text | reviewerId | timestamp |

**Important:** Add this header row manually before first use — the script
does not auto-create it, and `getReviews` needs the header row to map
columns.

### Tab: `Errors` (new)
| timestamp | message | stack | url | userAgent | extra |

(Headers auto-created on first write.) Fed by `src/lib/telemetry.ts`, which
catches uncaught client errors and unhandled promise rejections, dedupes
them, caps each browser session at 10 reports, and fire-and-forget POSTs a
`logError` action here. If this tab doesn't exist yet, `logError` just
no-ops instead of failing — you don't need to create it before deploying,
only before you want errors to actually start showing up somewhere.

---

## 2. Add the Apps Script

1. In the sheet: **Extensions → Apps Script**.
2. Replace `Code.gs` with the project's `Code.gs` (the one you provided).
3. Save the project (name it e.g. "The Layout Backend").

### Optional hardening (recommended)

Add this at the top of `submitReview` so the Reviews sheet is
auto-initialized if empty:

```js
ensureHeaders(sheet, ["id","productId","name","rating","text","reviewerId","timestamp"]);
```

---

## 3. Deploy as Web App

1. Click **Deploy → New deployment**.
2. Type: **Web app**.
3. Description: `The Layout API v1`.
4. **Execute as**: `Me` (your Google account).
5. **Who has access**: `Anyone` (required — the site calls it without login).
6. Click **Deploy**, authorize the scopes when prompted
   (Sheets + Drive — Drive is needed to save payment screenshots).
7. Copy the **Web app URL** (ends in `/exec`).

### Re-deploying after edits
Every code change needs a new **version** to go live:
**Deploy → Manage deployments → pencil icon → Version: New version → Deploy**.
The URL stays the same.

**This applies to the concurrency/telemetry update in this `Code.gs`** — it
adds `LockService` locking around every write handler (`logCart`,
`completeOrder`, `submitReview`, `deleteReview`, `spinLead`), a new
`logError` action, screenshot mime-type detection, and the invoice
template-row aggregation. None of it takes effect until you push a new
deployment version.

---

## 4. Wire it into the frontend

Open `src/lib/catalog.ts` and set:

```ts
export const CONFIG = {
  GAS_URL: "https://script.google.com/macros/s/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX/exec",
  // ...
};
```

Until this is set, `src/lib/gas.ts` runs in mock mode
(coupon `LAYOUT10` = 10%, empty reviews, no writes).

---

## 5. API contract (what the frontend sends)

All POSTs use `Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8` (to avoid a CORS
preflight); the body is JSON. Apps Script reads it from
`e.postData.contents`.

| Action | Method | Payload | Response |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| `validateCoupon` | GET `?action=validateCoupon&code=XYZ` | — | `{ valid, percent?, message? }` |
| `getReviews` | GET `?action=getReviews&productId=strip-1` | — | `{ reviews: [...] }` |
| `logCart` | POST | `{ action, cartId, customer, cart, total, ts }` | `{ ok, cartId }` |
| `completeOrder` | POST | `{ action, orderId, cartId, customer, cart, total, coupon?, screenshot?, screenshotName?, ts }` | `{ ok, orderId }` |
| `submitReview` | POST | `{ action, productId, name, rating, text, reviewerId }` | `{ ok, id }` |
| `deleteReview` | POST | `{ action, id, reviewerId }` | `{ ok }` |
| `logError` | POST | `{ action, message, stack?, url, userAgent, ts, ...extra }` | `{ ok }` |

`logCart`, `completeOrder`, `submitReview`, `deleteReview`, and `spinLead`
all run inside a script-wide `LockService` lock (30s wait, then a `{ ok:
false, error: "Server is busy…" }`/`{ success: false, ... }` response) so
concurrent requests can't interleave mid-write. `logError` is intentionally
left unlocked — it's best-effort telemetry, not worth contending with a real
order write over.

`screenshot` is a data URL (`data:image/png;base64,...`). The script
strips the prefix, saves the file to a Drive folder called
**"The Layout — Payment Screenshots"**, and stores the shareable URL.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **"Invalid code (backend not configured)"** — `GAS_URL` still starts with
  `REPLACE`. Set it in `src/lib/catalog.ts`.
- **CORS error** — you edited `gas.ts` to send `application/json`. Keep it
  as `text/plain` so the browser skips the preflight.
- **`SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet()` returns null** — the script
  isn't bound to a sheet. Open the sheet → Extensions → Apps Script (do
  not create the script from script.google.com standalone).
- **Reviews return empty / column undefined** — the `Reviews` tab is
  missing the header row. Add it manually (see §1).
- **Changes not showing after edit** — you didn't publish a new version.
  Deploy → Manage deployments → New version.
- **Drive permission error on screenshots** — re-run the deployment flow
  and grant Drive access when prompted.
- **Still failing after granting Drive access + redeploying** — check
  whether `appsscript.json` has a manually-added `oauthScopes` array. Once
  that key exists, Apps Script stops auto-detecting scopes from your code
  and grants *only* what's listed — so a missing or too-narrow entry (e.g.
  `drive.file` instead of `drive`; `getFoldersByName` needs the full
  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` scope since it searches all of
  Drive, not just app-created files) will keep Drive calls failing even
  though "Google Drive" shows up as an authorized permission. Easiest fix:
  delete the `oauthScopes` key entirely and let Apps Script auto-manage
  scopes, then re-authorize (run any function that calls `DriveApp` once
  manually from the editor) and deploy a new version. The exact failure
  reason is always in the `screenshotUrl` column as `ERROR: <message>` —
  check that first before guessing.

## 7. Spin-the-Wheel lead capture

The wheel's prizes are entirely sheet-driven — there is nothing to edit in
code to add, remove, reorder, reweight, or pause a prize. `Code.gs` already
implements `getSpinConfig` and `handleSpinLead`; you only need to create the
two tabs below.

**You don't have to create `Spin Config` before the wheel works.** If that
tab doesn't exist yet, the backend uses a built-in default prize list (the
same one shown in the example rows below) so spins still work and get
recorded in `Spin Leads` immediately. Once you create the tab, it fully
takes over.

### Tab: `Spin Config`
| Order | Label | Icon | Code | Weight | Active | Color |
|-------|-------|------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | FREE 1 Polaroid Strip | polaroid | SPINPOLA | 20 | TRUE | |
| 2 | FREE Personalized Letter | envelope | SPINLETTER | 20 | TRUE | |
| 3 | 10% OFF Your Magazine Order | tag | SPIN10 | 25 | TRUE | |
| 4 | FREE Sticker Pack | sticker | SPINSTICK | 20 | TRUE | |
| 5 | Better Luck Next Time | clover | | 15 | TRUE | |

- **Order**: controls slice position clockwise from the top (1, 2, 3…).
- **Label**: shown on the wheel slice and the result screen.
- **Icon**: a key the frontend maps to an icon — `polaroid`, `envelope`,
  `tag`, `sticker`, `clover`. An unrecognized key falls back to a default
  gift icon (and logs a console warning) instead of breaking anything.
- **Code**: coupon code to grant; leave blank for a non-prize segment
  ("Better luck next time").
- **Weight**: relative odds, any positive number — doesn't need to sum to
  100.
- **Active**: `TRUE`/`FALSE` (or `1`/`0`) — `FALSE` rows are excluded from
  both the wheel and the win-picking logic, so you can pause a prize
  without deleting its row/history.
- **Color**: optional hex code for the slice fill. Leave blank to let the
  frontend cycle through its default palette.

Add, remove, reorder, or edit rows any time — the site picks up changes on
the next page load, no redeploy required.

### Tab: `Spin Leads`
| Timestamp | Email | Marketing Opt-in | Segment Won | Coupon Code | Session ID | Redeemed | Expires At |

(Headers auto-created on first write.)

The homepage popup posts `{ action: "spinLead", email, optIn, sessionId }`;
the server enforces one spin per email and picks the winning segment
server-side (never trust the client) by reading the same `Spin Config` tab
the wheel rendered from, so the visible odds and the actual odds can never
drift apart. If `Spin Config` exists but every row is inactive (or the
sheet is emptied out), both `getSpinConfig` and `handleSpinLead` return
`{ success: false, error: "Spin wheel is not configured" }` instead of
crashing — the frontend responds by hiding the spin trigger entirely. This
is a deliberate kill-switch: emptying the sheet pauses the whole feature
without touching code.

The frontend falls back to a small local mock config if `GAS_URL` is not
yet configured, so the popup still works end-to-end during development.

---

## 8. Final build checklist (current state)

- `CONFIG.GAS_URL` in `src/lib/catalog.ts` **is** set to a deployed `/exec`
  URL, so the site is live against the sheet (not mock mode).
- Tabs the deployed script needs: `Coupons`, `Cart Logs`, `Completed Orders`,
  `Reviews` (header row must be added manually), `Spin Config` (optional —
  falls back to defaults), `Spin Leads`.
- After any edit to `Code.gs`, publish a **new version** of the deployment or
  the live site keeps running the old code.

### What order handling does today

There is **no online payment gateway** — payment happens out-of-band and is
confirmed manually. Invoice and shipping-label PDFs **are** generated
automatically:

1. Cart is logged to `Cart Logs` (`logCart`) with customer details + totals.
2. Customer pays out-of-band and uploads a **payment screenshot**.
3. `completeOrder` generates a PDF invoice (`generateInvoicePdf_`) and a PDF
   shipping label (`generateShippingLabelPdf_`), saving each to its own
   Drive folder ("The Layout — Invoices" / "The Layout — Shipping Labels",
   both shared "anyone with the link"), then writes the row to
   `Completed Orders` with an order id, itemised cart, total, coupon, the
   screenshot link, and links to both generated documents.
4. Neither document is emailed automatically — both are for manual
   review/printing from the Drive links in the sheet. Confirmation continues
   over WhatsApp.

The `Completed Orders` sheet is therefore the order/receipt record. If a
numbered invoice emailed to the customer or a payment gateway is wanted,
that's a separate build.

## 9. Phone numbers as text + auto-fitting shipping labels

Two fixes that need a **new deployment version** to take effect:

1. **Phone / WhatsApp / pincode columns are written as text.** Sheets used to
   read `+919876543210` as the start of a formula and show `#ERROR!`.
   `forceTextColumns_` sets those columns' number format to plain text (`@`)
   and `sanitizeTextCell_` escapes any value starting with `+`, `=`, `-`, or
   `@`. The escape character is not part of the stored value — the cell still
   reads `+919876543210`, and invoices/labels are unaffected.
   Existing `#ERROR!` cells stay broken until re-typed; new rows are fine.
2. **Shipping label text auto-fits.** Name, phone, email, and address font
   sizes are now computed per order (`shippingFitFontSize_`), and long
   unbroken strings wrap instead of spilling past the border, so the label
   always keeps the same 6in × 4in layout.
