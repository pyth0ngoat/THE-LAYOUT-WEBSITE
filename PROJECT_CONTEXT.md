# The Layout — Project Context

**Purpose of this file:** a complete technical + product handoff for whoever
(human or AI) works on this codebase next. It documents what exists, why it's
built the way it is, what's fragile, and what's still open — as of `main`
after commit `3a8e2bb` plus one further uncommitted session (see §11a) that
made Pocket Magazine multi-unit, reordered it below Templates, gave the
Friendship Card a Z-axis spin + better lighting, added scroll nudges, and
added a shipping-label PDF alongside the invoice. Update this file when you
make a structural change; it will go stale otherwise, same as any doc.

For **editing content/prices/media without touching code**, see
`Website_GUIDE/` instead — that's the non-coder-facing guide. This file is
the engineering map.

## 1. What this project is

**The Layout** is a single-page e-commerce site selling custom-printed
keepsakes: magazines (Standard A4 / Mini A5, page-count tiers), a Pocket
Magazine, a Newspaper Magazine, a Friendship Card, polaroid packs, polaroid
strips, and add-ons (gift wrap, handwritten letter), plus curated
bundle "combos." Checkout collects customer details and a manually-uploaded
UPI payment screenshot — there is **no payment gateway** and **no login/auth
system**. Orders + reviews + coupons + a lead-capture spin wheel are all
backed by a single Google Sheet driven by a Google Apps Script Web App (see
§6).

The whole customer-facing site is **one route** (`/`, `src/routes/index.tsx`)
— a long scrolling page with anchor-linked sections — plus a second static
page (`/happy-customers`) for a testimonials wall.

## 2. Tech stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | **TanStack Start** (`@tanstack/react-start`) + **TanStack Router** | File-based routing under `src/routes/`; `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is **generated — never hand-edit it**. |
| UI | **React 19** | Uses React 19's native custom-elements support (see §9.4, the 3D viewer). |
| Bundler/dev server | **Vite 8** | Config at `vite.config.ts`, itself a thin wrapper over `@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config` (see §2.1). |
| Server runtime target | **Nitro** (`nitro` devDependency, v3 beta) → **Cloudflare Workers** via the `cloudflare-module` preset (default) | See §10 for the full deployment story. |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS v4** (`@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, CSS-first config in `src/styles.css` — no `tailwind.config.js`) | Custom design tokens (`--color-rose-wine` etc.) — see §8. |
| Component primitives | **shadcn/ui** ("new-york" style, see `components.json`) built on **Radix UI** | Lives in `src/components/ui/` — mostly unused scaffolding; the actual site UI is hand-built in `src/components/site/`. |
| State | **Zustand** (`src/lib/store.ts`), persisted to `localStorage` | See §5. |
| Backend | **Google Apps Script + Google Sheets** (`code.gs`, pasted into the Sheet's script editor) | See §6. No Node/Cloudflare-side backend — the Worker only does SSR. |
| Icons | **lucide-react** | |
| Toasts | **sonner** | |
| 3D | **`@google/model-viewer`**, vendored as a static asset, *not* imported as a JS module (see §9.4) | |
| Package manager | Both **npm** (`package-lock.json`) and **bun** (`bun.lock`, `bunfig.toml`) are tracked in the repo | See §9.1 — pick one and keep the other in sync, or expect drift. |

### 2.1 The `@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config` wrapper

`vite.config.ts` is intentionally thin — almost all Vite/TanStack
Start/Nitro/React-plugin wiring lives inside the `@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config`
package (a Lovable.dev starter-kit dependency). This project was originally
scaffolded via Lovable. The wrapper's own comment block warns: **do not
manually add the TanStack Start / React / Tailwind / Nitro plugins** — they're
already included, and duplicating them breaks the build. Only pass additional
config via `defineConfig({ vite: {...}, nitro: {...}, ... })`.

Notably: **the type surface for `nitro` overrides is narrow on purpose**
(`preset`, `output`, `cloudflare: { nodeCompat, deployConfig }` only — see
`node_modules/@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config/dist/index.d.ts`). You cannot
pass arbitrary Nitro/Rollup options (e.g. `rollupConfig.external`) through
this wrapper. If you ever need to, you'd have to either fork the wrapper's
config or drop down to a raw Nitro config file — this was tried once (§9.4)
and abandoned in favor of a different fix.

The wrapper also includes an **HMR-gate plugin** and **sandbox
port/host detection**, both meant for the Lovable cloud sandbox — they're
inert outside that environment.

## 4. Component architecture (the "section" pattern)

Every homepage feature (Sizes, Templates, Pocket Magazine, Newspaper
Magazine, Friendship Card, Combos, Add-ons, Polaroid Packs, Polaroid Strips,
Delivery) is either:

**(a) A bespoke section component** — most of them. Pattern:
- Exported `XSection()` component rendering a grid of cards inside a
  `bg-rose-wine rounded-3xl` panel, each card: thumbnail/visual, name,
  price, a "Select"/"Selected" pill button, and a "View"/eye icon that opens
  a modal.
- A co-located `XModal()` — full detail view, larger visual, description,
  bullet list of what's included, an "Add"/"Select" button, and (except
  Delivery) a `<ReviewsPanel>` fed by `useProductReviews(productId)`.
- State comes from `useStore()` (Zustand) and `CATALOG.<category>` (static
  product data).

**(b) The generic `ProductGrid` + `ProductModal`** (`shop.tsx`) — used only
for categories that don't need bespoke visuals/behavior: currently just
`delivery` (rendered directly in `index.tsx`) and as a fallback pattern.
Sizes and Templates *used to* be closer to this generic pattern but have
been fully replaced by bespoke components (`sizes-section.tsx`,
`templates-section.tsx`) because of format-toggle / dual-magazine
complexity — don't be surprised the generic components look
underused relative to their apparent generality.

| File | Category | Notable behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `sizes-section.tsx` | `sizes` | Standard(A4)/Mini(A5) format toggle; picking a size clears any active combo and resets template selection. |
| `templates-section.tsx` | `templates` | Renders the normal magazine's template grid only — see §5.3. Has a "Randomise for me" shuffle button. Shares its grid/detail-modal UI with `pocket-section.tsx` via `template-picker.tsx`. |
| `pocket-section.tsx` | `pocket`, `pocket-templates` | Standalone, **multi-unit** product (see §5.3) — a customer can add several Pocket Magazines; each renders its own template grid + "Remove" control directly below the product card, keyed by a `unit` uid. Positioned in `index.tsx` *after* the normal Templates section (§11a) so selecting one immediately reveals its own picker instead of sending the customer to a shared grid elsewhere. |
| `template-picker.tsx` | — | Shared, store-agnostic `TemplateGrid` + `TemplateDetailModal` — the caller (normal-magazine `templates-section.tsx`, or once per Pocket Magazine unit in `pocket-section.tsx`) passes in selection/limit/toggle callbacks. Not a "section" itself. |
| `scroll-hint.tsx` | — | `<ScrollHint text targetId>` — a small bouncing-chevron pill shown after picking a size or a Pocket Magazine, prompting a scroll down to that product's template picker. Not category-specific. |
| `newspaper-section.tsx` | `newspaper` | Standalone product; two **fixed, non-pickable** preview spreads (`NEWSPAPER_TEMPLATES` in `catalog.ts`) — not user-selectable templates. |
| `friendship-section.tsx` | `friendship`, `friendship-designs` | Standalone product with an **interactive 3D model viewer** instead of a photo — see §9.4. Two-step selection, same shape as Sizes → Templates: Step 1 picks a quantity tier (Single/Duo, single-choice, MRP-strikethrough pricing) via `setFriendship()`; Step 2 picks 1 (Single) or up to 2 (Duo) of 4 fixed designs via `toggleFriendshipDesign()`, rendered as a fixed 2-per-row grid with a front/back swipeable detail modal (`FriendshipDesignDetailModal`) — see §5.3a. |
| `combos-section.tsx` | `combos` | One-click bundles; auto-populates size/add-ons/polaroids/strips per `COMBO_RECIPES` in `catalog.ts`. Shows "original total" (computed live via `comboRealTotal()`, never hand-typed) struck through. |
| `addons-section.tsx` | `addons` | Gift Wrap / Handwritten Letter / Combo(both) — generic single-choice with a note field in the modal. |
| `strips-section.tsx` | `strips` | Multi-select up to 5, **bundle-priced by count** (`STRIP_TIERS`), not per-item. |
| `packs-section.tsx` | `polaroids` | 4 fixed packs (9/18/27/36 photos), imported via `src/assets/polaroids/*.webp` (bundled, not `public/`). |
| `spin-wheel.tsx` | — | Lead-capture popup; prize config fetched live from the backend (`getSpinConfig`), see §6.7. |
| `reviews-panel.tsx` | — | `<ReviewStars>` + `<ReviewsPanel>` — shared UI, not category-specific. |
| `shop.tsx` | — | The catch-all: `ProductGrid`, `ProductModal`, `CartDrawer`, `CustomerInfoModal`, `PaymentModal`, `SuccessModal`, `ModalShell`, `StepIndicator`, `CartButton`, `PromoCodeBox`, `CartSummaryPanel`, `DeliveryEta`. This is the biggest file (~1090 lines) and the one most other files import `ModalShell` from. |

**Every section follows the same interaction contract**, which matters if
you add a new one: click card → toggle selection (toast feedback); click
"View"/eye → open modal with fuller detail + reviews; the *same* toggle
action is reachable from both places. Categories that allow only one active
item at a time are listed in `singleChoice` inside `store.ts`'s `addItem`.

---

## 5. State: `src/lib/store.ts` (Zustand + persist)

### 5.1 Shape

```ts
cart: CartItem[]                        // the actual order — see below
format: "standard" | "mini"             // magazine trim size toggle
selectedSizeId: string | null           // e.g. "sz-8" or "sz-8-mini"
selectedTemplateIds: string[]           // for the NORMAL magazine (tied to selectedSizeId)
selectedPocketTemplateIds: string[]     // for the Pocket Magazine — independent of the above
stripSelections: string[]               // which of strip-1..strip-5 are picked
coupon: { code, percent } | null
cartId: string | null                   // set once CustomerInfoModal submits (logCart)
customer: {...} | null                  // deliberately NOT persisted (see partialize below)
```

`CartItem`:
```ts
{ key, category, id, name, price, note?, comboId?, promoCode? }
```
`key` is always `${category}:${id}` (with one exception: strips collapse to
a single `strips:bundle` line — see §5.2). `comboId` marks a line as
auto-added by a combo (price 0, real charge is on the combo's own line;
can only be removed by removing the whole combo). `promoCode` marks a free
item granted by a redeemed spin-wheel coupon.

### 5.2 Category behavior rules (read before adding a category)

Three category lists in `store.ts` govern cross-category interactions —
**get a new category into the right ones or it will misbehave with combos**:

- `singleChoice` (inside `addItem`): only one item of this category can be in
  the cart at once — selecting a new one silently replaces the old one.
- `COMBO_INDEPENDENT`: categories a combo never touches. Adding/removing
  these must **not** drop an active combo. (`delivery`, `newspaper`,
  `pocket`, `pocket-templates`, `friendship`, `friendship-designs`, `promotions`.)
- `COMBO_MANAGED`: categories a combo recipe *can* auto-populate. Selecting a
  combo wipes anything manually picked in these first, so the real price
  never sits in the cart alongside the combo's flat price. (`sizes`,
  `templates`, `addons`, `polaroids`, `strips`.)

If a category belongs to neither list, `addItem`'s default (`dropCombo`
whenever that category is touched) applies — i.e. it silently kills any
active combo. That's correct for `COMBO_MANAGED` categories going through
dedicated actions (`setSize`, `toggleTemplate`, `toggleStrip` all call
`dropCombo` explicitly too) but would be **wrong** for a new standalone
product — remember to add it to `COMBO_INDEPENDENT`.

### 5.3 Two parallel "magazine + templates" systems (Pocket is now multi-unit)

This is the single most important structural fact for future work: **there
are two independent magazine *systems* that can be in the cart
simultaneously**, each with its own template selection — and the Pocket
Magazine one supports **any number of units**, each with its own picks
(added in §11a; a customer can buy 2-3 Pocket Magazines in one order):

| | Normal magazine (Standard/Mini) | Pocket Magazine (per unit) |
|---|---|---|
| Selected via | `selectedSizeId` (+ a `sizes` cart line) | one `pocket` cart line per unit, each tagged `unit: <uid>` |
| How many at once | Exactly 0 or 1 | 0 or more — `pocketUnits: { uid, templateIds }[]` in `store.ts`, one entry per Pocket Magazine |
| Template category | `templates` | `pocket-templates` — each line also carries the same `unit` uid as its parent `pocket` line |
| Template state | `selectedTemplateIds` (flat array) | `pocketUnits[i].templateIds` (one array per unit) |
| Template limit | `templateLimit()` — derived from the chosen size's `templateLimit` field (1–17, scales with page count) | `pocketTemplateLimit()` — constant `POCKET_TEMPLATE_LIMIT = 3`, applies per unit |
| Add/select action | `setSize(id)` | `addPocketUnit()` — appends a new unit + cart line, never goes through `addItem` (removed from `singleChoice` in §11a) |
| Remove action | `removeItem(key)` (cart-line generic) | `removePocketUnit(uid)`, or `removeItem(key)` on the pocket line (handles unit cleanup too) |
| Toggle template action | `toggleTemplate(id)` | `togglePocketTemplate(uid, id)` |
| Randomize action | `randomizeTemplates()` | `randomizePocketTemplates(uid)` |

**Both share the same 24 (currently) template *designs*** — `CATALOG.templates`
and `CATALOG["pocket-templates"]` point at the literal same array
(`TEMPLATES` in `catalog.ts`). The **cart line's `category`** field (plus,
for Pocket, its `unit` field) is what ties a template pick to the right
product. `templates-section.tsx` renders the normal magazine's grid only;
`pocket-section.tsx` renders one grid **per pocket unit**, each in its own
bordered block with a `#pocket-unit-<uid>` anchor (used by both the
checkout-gate scroll and each unit's own `<ScrollHint>`). Both reuse the
same store-agnostic `<TemplateGrid>`/`<TemplateDetailModal>` from
`template-picker.tsx` rather than duplicating the grid/modal UI.

**Every checkout gate that checks "are templates complete" checks both
independently** — this was a real bug class introduced when Pocket Magazine
was added, and multi-unit Pocket makes it worse if you're not careful: a
gate now has to loop `pocketUnits` and fail if **any** unit is short, not
just check one flat array. If you add a third such product, grep for
`selectedTemplateIds`/`templateLimit`/`pocketUnits` across `shop.tsx`,
`index.tsx`, `pocket-section.tsx`, `templates-section.tsx`, and `code.gs`
and mirror every hit for the new product, or a customer can check out with
an incomplete order.

### 5.3a A third parent+sub-selection pair: the Friendship Card

The Friendship Card (§9.4) is exactly the "third such product" the warning
above anticipated — `selectedFriendshipId` (parent, mirrors
`selectedSizeId`) drives `selectedFriendshipDesignIds` (sub-selection,
mirrors `selectedTemplateIds`), capped by `friendshipDesignLimit()` (reads
`designLimit` off the chosen `friendship` tier — 1 for Single, 2 for Duo —
mirroring `templateLimit()`). It's flat rather than multi-unit like Pocket
(only ever one Friendship Card line per order), so it's closer in shape to
Sizes→Templates than to Pocket. Its own category is `friendship-designs`,
selected via `toggleFriendshipDesign()`.

One behavior it deliberately does **not** copy from `setSize`: switching
the parent (`setFriendship()`, e.g. Duo → Single while 2 designs are
picked) **truncates** `selectedFriendshipDesignIds` to the new limit
(keeping the first-picked design(s)) instead of clearing it to `[]` the way
`setSize` clears `selectedTemplateIds` on every size change. A full clear
only happens via `removeItem()` on the `friendship` line itself (or
re-clicking the active tier, which routes to the same removal), which also
clears `selectedFriendshipId` and drops any `friendship-designs` cart lines
— same shape as `removeItem()` clearing `selectedSizeId`/templates when a
`sizes` line is removed.

Both the on-site cart drawer and `code.gs`'s invoice/shipping-label logic
fold `friendship-designs` picks into a note under the parent `friendship`
row (`Design:- Card 02`, or `Design:- Card 01, Card 03` for Duo) rather than
letting them leak through as their own bare rows — same pattern §6.4 uses
for `templates`/`pocket-templates`. The checkout gate lives in three places,
same as templates/pocket: `CartDrawer` (`friendshipDesignsIncomplete` in
`shop.tsx`), `startCheckout()` in `index.tsx` (scrolls to
`#friendship-card`), and `code.gs`'s `shippingItemSummaryLines_` EXCLUDE map
(so a design pick never appears as its own "Card 01" line on a shipping
label).

**Persisted-store migration:** `pocketUnits` replaced the old flat
`selectedPocketTemplateIds` array, which is a shape change to a persisted
key (see §5.4's "Adding new persisted keys is safe... Removing or renaming
... would need a real migration"). `store.ts` bumped `version: 2` and its
`migrate()` stripped any pre-v2 `pocket`/`pocket-templates` cart lines rather
than leaving a `pocket` line in an old visitor's `localStorage` cart with no
matching unit to render a picker for (which would have let that one item
through checkout incomplete). The Friendship Card redesign is the same risk
again — an old blob's `friendship` cart line has no matching
`selectedFriendshipId`, so the design-limit gate would treat it as
already-complete (limit 0) — so `store.ts` bumped `version: 3` and extended
`migrate()` to also strip any pre-v3 `friendship`/`friendship-designs` lines.

### 5.4 Persistence

`zustand/middleware persist`, key `the-layout-cart`, `localStorage`.
**`skipHydration: true`** — the store does *not* auto-hydrate on creation;
`__root.tsx`'s `RootComponent` calls `useStore.persist.rehydrate()` manually
inside a `useEffect` after mount. This is deliberate: the store module
re-evaluates fresh per request under SSR, so auto-hydrating at creation time
would apply `localStorage` state before React's first client render and
mismatch the (always-empty) server-rendered HTML, causing a hydration error.
**If you ever see a hydration mismatch involving cart state, check this
first.**

`customer` is deliberately excluded from `partialize` (not persisted) —
re-asking for shipping/contact info after a refresh is an acceptable cost
next to silently resurrecting stale PII from `localStorage` indefinitely.

`version: 3` (see §5.3a for what each bump stripped and why). **Adding new
persisted keys is safe without a version bump** (Zustand's default merge
keeps the new key's initial value for old `localStorage` blobs that don't
have it) — this is how `selectedFriendshipId`/`selectedFriendshipDesignIds`
themselves were added with no bump needed for *their* existence; the bump to
3 was only needed to actively strip stale pre-redesign `friendship` cart
lines, not to add the keys. Removing or renaming a persisted key, or
changing its shape, would need a real migration or accept that returning
customers' local carts silently reset.

## 6. Backend: Google Apps Script + Google Sheets (`code.gs`)

Full setup instructions live in `Website_GUIDE/BACKEND_SETUP.md` (see §6.5
for a note on that guide's accuracy).

### 6.1 Architecture

`code.gs` is pasted directly into the Apps Script editor bound to a Google
Sheet ("Extensions → Apps Script" from inside the Sheet — **not** a
standalone script.google.com project, or `SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet()`
returns null). It's deployed as a Web App (`Deploy → New deployment → Web
app`, execute as "Me", access "Anyone"). The frontend's only handle to it is
one URL: `CONFIG.GAS_URL` in `src/lib/catalog.ts`, currently a live
`/exec` URL (not the `REPLACE...` placeholder, i.e. **the site is not in mock
mode**).

`src/lib/gas.ts` is the only file that talks to it. It POSTs
`Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8` deliberately (not
`application/json`) to avoid a CORS preflight — **do not "fix" this to
`application/json`**, it will break cross-origin calls. Every call has a
hard timeout (`AbortController`, 15s default / 60s for the order+screenshot
upload), retries transport failures only (never a definitive HTTP error
response), and reports failures to `telemetry.ts`.

### 6.2 Sheet tabs (headers must match `BACKEND_SETUP.md` §1 exactly)

| Tab | Auto-created headers? | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `Coupons` | No — create manually | Read-only from the app; you manage rows by hand |
| `Cart Logs` | Yes, on first write | `logCart` (fires when `CustomerInfoModal` submits, before payment) |
| `Completed Orders` | Yes, on first write | `completeOrder` (fires after payment screenshot upload) |
| `Reviews` | **No — must be added manually before first use** | `submitReview`/`deleteReview`/`getReviews` |
| `Errors` | Yes, on first write (tab itself must exist or writes just no-op) | `logError` (from `telemetry.ts`) |
| `Spin Config` | N/A — optional, falls back to a hardcoded default list if absent | Read-only; you manage rows by hand |
| `Spin Leads` | Yes, on first write | `handleSpinLead` |

Every write handler except `logError` runs inside a script-wide
`LockService` lock (30s wait, then a "server is busy" response) so
concurrent requests can't interleave mid-write (e.g. two orders racing on
`ensureHeaders`). `logError` is deliberately left unlocked — best-effort
telemetry isn't worth lock-contending with a real order write.

### 6.3 `completeOrder` — what actually happens on checkout

1. Payment screenshot (a data URL) is decoded and saved to a Drive folder
   **"The Layout — Payment Screenshots"**, shared "anyone with the link."
2. **A PDF invoice is generated** (`generateInvoicePdf_`) — HTML built
   in-memory (`buildInvoiceHtml_`) and converted to PDF via Apps Script's
   blob conversion (no Docs/Slides template involved — the design is 100%
   in that function's inline CSS). Saved to a Drive folder **"The Layout —
   Invoices,"** shared "anyone with the link." **Not auto-emailed** — the
   commented-out `sendInvoiceEmail_` call is right there if you want to turn
   that on.
3. A row is appended to `Completed Orders`: `orderId, cartId, name, phone,
   email, address, cart (JSON), total, coupon, screenshotUrl, timestamp,
   invoiceUrl, paymentVerified` (last column defaults to `"Pending..."` —
   there's no UI to change it; whoever manages the sheet edits it by hand
   after verifying payment).

Both the screenshot save and invoice generation are wrapped so a Drive
failure never blocks the order row itself from being written — you'll see
`"ERROR: <message>"` in the `screenshotUrl`/`invoiceUrl` column instead of a
failed request. **Check that column first** when something's wrong with
screenshots or invoices — the actual failure reason is right there.

### 6.4 Invoice line-item formatting (`buildInvoiceHtml_`)

Template categories (`templates`, `pocket-templates`) are **zero-cost cart
lines** that would otherwise pad the invoice with a run of ₹0.00 rows — the
code filters them out of the itemized list and instead folds them into a
single note line under their magazine's row, e.g.
`Templates:- 3, 7, 12`. Category-specific label logic:

| Category | Invoice label | Template note |
|---|---|---|
| `sizes` | `Custom Magazine (8 Pages, Normal Magazine, A4)` — spells out Mini vs Standard since both share the same `item.name` ("8 Pages") and only the id suffix (`-mini`) distinguishes them | `Templates:- <normal template numbers>` |
| `pocket` | `Pocket Magazine (6 Pages, Pocket Size)` | `Templates:- <pocket template numbers>` |
| `friendship` | `Friendship Card (Single Card)` / `Friendship Card (Duo Card — BESTIE SET)` — **parenthesized, not dash-prefixed**, because the Duo product's own name already contains an em-dash (`Duo Card — BESTIE SET`); a second leading dash there reads as a typo | `Design:- <picked design names>`, e.g. `Design:- Card 02` (Single) or `Design:- Card 01, Card 03` (Duo) — folded from the `friendship-designs` category the same way template picks are folded above (see §5.3a); free-text customisation still prints separately via `item.note` |
| anything else | `item.name` as-is | — |

If you add another product category with its own "sub-selection" concept
(like templates), **mirror this exact pattern**: a dedicated cart category
for the sub-items, filtered out of `invoiceCart`, folded into a note under
the parent row. Don't let a new zero-price category leak through as bare
₹0.00 invoice rows.

With Pocket Magazine now multi-unit (§5.3), each `pocket` cart line and its
matching `pocket-templates` lines share a `unit` uid — `buildInvoiceHtml_`
groups `pocketTemplateItems` into `pocketTemplateLabelsByUnit` keyed by
`t.unit || ""` and looks each `pocket` row up by its own `item.unit || ""`,
so a 3-Pocket-Magazine order's invoice shows each row's own templates, not
every unit's templates on every row. Cart lines from before this fix (no
`unit` field at all) all fall into the `""` bucket together, which
reproduces the old flat-list behavior for anything logged pre-migration —
deliberate, not an oversight. Verified with a standalone `.mjs` against
synthetic single-unit, multi-unit, and unit-less carts before being pasted
into `code.gs`, same verification method as `shippingItemSummaryHtml_`
below.

### 6.3a Shipping labels

`completeOrder` also generates a **PDF shipping label** alongside the
invoice — `generateShippingLabelPdf_(order)` / `buildShippingLabelHtml_`,
saved to its own Drive folder ("The Layout — Shipping Labels", "anyone with
the link"), same wrapped-in-try/catch-so-a-Drive-failure-never-blocks-the-
order pattern as the invoice and screenshot save. Its Drive link (or an
`ERROR: <message>` string on failure) is written to a new `shippingLabel`
column, added immediately after `paymentVerified` in `Completed Orders` —
`ensureHeaders` appends it automatically to existing sheets since it's the
last item in the passed header array, no manual sheet edit needed.

Design intentionally diverges from the invoice: it's a compact
courier-label layout (black banner with "NORMAL SHIPPING"/"EXPRESS
SHIPPING" — read from the `delivery` cart line's id — plus the logo; a
two-column body; order number + thank-you footer), sized via `@page { size:
6in 4in; }` rather than a full invoice page. The **ITEM** cell deliberately
uses coarser, category-level labels than the invoice (`shippingItemLabel_`
— e.g. "A4 Magazine", "Pocket Magazine", never page counts or notes) and
collapses repeats to a count (`shippingItemSummaryHtml_` — "Pocket Magazine
× 3", not three lines) so a packer sees what to grab, not the customer's
exact spec. `templates`/`pocket-templates`/`friendship-designs`/`delivery`
categories and combo-linked (`comboId` set) lines are excluded from that
cell the same way the invoice excludes templates from its rows.

### 6.5 `Website_GUIDE/BACKEND_SETUP.md` §8 — now accurate

An earlier version of this file warned that `BACKEND_SETUP.md`'s §8 claimed
**"no automatic invoice or PDF generation"**, which was false once invoice
PDF generation (§6.3) was added — that's since been corrected in
`BACKEND_SETUP.md` itself, and its §8 now correctly describes invoice +
shipping-label PDF generation (payment stays out-of-band, confirmed
manually — that half was always accurate). §8 is a high-level order-flow
summary, not itemized per feature, so it doesn't need a line for every
product addition (Pocket Magazine, Friendship Card, etc.) — just keep it
accurate on the overall shape of what `completeOrder` does. If you make a
structural change to that shape (e.g. adding a payment gateway, or emailing
documents automatically), update `BACKEND_SETUP.md` §8 there too, not just
here.

### 6.6 Redeploy discipline

**Every edit to `code.gs` requires a new Apps Script deployment *version*
to go live** — editing the script source alone does nothing to the running
Web App. `Deploy → Manage deployments → pencil icon → Version: New version
→ Deploy`. The URL stays the same, so no frontend change is needed. As of
this file's writing, **code.gs changes are sitting undeployed**:
- The Pocket Magazine invoice row + template note (§6.4).
- The Friendship Card invoice row + note.
- The Friendship Card **design** note (`Design:- Card 02`, etc.) and the
  `friendship-designs` exclusion in `shippingItemSummaryLines_`'s EXCLUDE
  map (§5.3a, §6.4) — from the Friendship Card's two-step quantity→design
  redesign.

- The new `shippingLabel` column + `generateShippingLabelPdf_` (§6.3a,
  §11a) — also undeployed as of this writing.

All are inert on the live site until one redeploy happens. No manual Google
Sheet column changes are needed for any of them — carts are logged as an
opaque JSON blob, and `ensureHeaders` handles new sheet columns (including
`shippingLabel`) automatically.

### 6.7 Spin-the-wheel

Entirely sheet-driven (`Spin Config` tab) — no code change needed to
add/remove/reorder/reweight/pause a prize; the frontend fetches live config
via `getSpinConfig`. Odds are enforced **server-side** (`handleSpinLead`
re-reads the same tab and does the weighted pick itself — the client-shown
wheel and the actual odds can never drift apart, and the client can't cheat
the odds). Emptying/deactivating every row in `Spin Config` is a deliberate
kill-switch — both endpoints then return `{ success: false }` and the
frontend hides the spin trigger entirely.

## 7. Media & asset conventions

**Full non-coder guide:** `Website_GUIDE/MEDIA.md`. Key structural facts for
engineering work:

- `public/media/<category>/` — one folder per product category. Referenced
  from `SITE.productImages[productId]` in `site-content.ts` (first array
  entry = card thumbnail, rest = gallery/lightbox images). Missing entry →
  automatic gradient-placeholder fallback (every card component has one) —
  **a missing image is never a hard error**, just a visibly worse card.
- Filenames are **case-sensitive in production** (the host, unlike
  Windows/Mac dev machines) — copy exact case from disk into
  `site-content.ts`.
- `SITE.templateCount` (currently **34**, bumped from 24 by a teammate mid-way
  through this session) drives how many `Template NN` cards render — see
  `catalog.ts`'s `TEMPLATES` array, generated via `Array.from({ length:
  SITE.templateCount }, ...)`. Bump the number first, art can follow later
  (missing `tpl-<n>` images just show a placeholder).
- **Friendship Card designs** (`card-1`..`card-4` in `productImages`) are
  front/back pairs at `public/media/friendship/CARD_01_FRONT.webp` /
  `CARD_01_BACK.webp` through `CARD_04_FRONT`/`CARD_04_BACK` (**uppercase**
  — added by a teammate after the initial build-out, which had guessed
  lowercase `card_01_front.webp`-style names; `productImages` was updated
  to match) — front is the grid thumbnail, back is what the customer swipes
  to in the design detail modal. The real art is a **landscape "Friendship
  Licence" card, ~1082×708px (≈3:2)**, not the portrait shape originally
  guessed before any art existed. Because an `<img>` has no built-in "file
  missing" signal (unlike an absent `productImages` entry, which every
  other card component degrades from cleanly per the bullet above),
  `friendship-section.tsx` wires an explicit `onError` handler per
  thumbnail/slide to swap in a small `FriendshipDesignPlaceholder` (not the
  landscape magazine-spread `TemplatePlaceholder` templates use) if a file
  is ever missing or fails to load. Both the grid thumbnail and the detail
  modal size their frame to the image (`w-full h-auto object-contain`, no
  fixed-aspect crop box on the `<img>` itself — only the *placeholder*
  branch carries a fixed aspect, `aspect-[1082/708]`, matching the real
  art's own ratio, purely so it has some shape to render when there's no
  image) rather than forcing the image into a fixed box — so nothing is
  ever cropped, and there's no letterbox either, since the box's own height
  always matches the image's real proportions exactly. All 4 designs share
  one physical card shape, so every thumbnail in the grid ends up the same
  height (see §11d, §11e).
- `public/_headers` sets `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
  for `/media/*`, `*.webp`, `*.mp4`, `*.svg`, `*.woff2`, and (as of this
  session) `/vendor/*`. This is a static-host header file — Cloudflare
  Workers Static Assets honors it the same way Cloudflare Pages does (see
  §10.5).
- `scripts/optimize-media.mjs` is a **manual, one-off** script (`node
  scripts/optimize-media.mjs`) that converts `public/media/**/*.{jpg,png}`
  to `.webp`, extracts PNGs baked into `bg/*.svg` and re-encodes those too,
  then deletes the now-unused originals. It's not wired into the build —
  run it by hand after dropping in new raster art, before committing.
- `src/assets/` (as opposed to `public/`) holds the **bundled** polaroid
  category photos and the logo — these go through Vite's asset pipeline
  (hashed filenames, imported as modules), unlike everything in `public/`
  which is served byte-for-byte at a stable path.

## 8. Design system

Defined in `src/styles.css` (Tailwind v4 CSS-first config — there is no
`tailwind.config.js`):

| Token | Hex | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-rose-wine` | `#c1476d` | Primary brand color — section backgrounds, headings |
| `--color-blush-rose` | `#e1477e` | Prices, accents |
| `--color-dusty-rose` | `#ba7080` | Secondary text |
| `--color-pink-mist` | `#e5a8ba` | Muted labels/eyebrows on dark backgrounds |
| `--color-off-white` | `#fcfbfc` | Text/pills on the rose-wine backgrounds |

Display font: **Instrument Serif** (`--font-display`, applied to `h1–h4` and
`.font-display`) via `@fontsource/instrument-serif`. Body font: Plus Jakarta
Sans via `@fontsource/plus-jakarta-sans`. Both self-hosted (no Google Fonts
CDN call at runtime).

Recurring visual pattern across every product section: a `rounded-3xl
bg-rose-wine` panel, product cards with a `ring-2 ring-off-white` active
state, a pill "Select"/"Selected" button, and a small circular "View"/eye
button. New sections should match this exactly for visual consistency — see
any existing `*-section.tsx` file as the template.

## 9. Known quirks, technical debt, and footguns

### 9.1 Two lockfiles

`package-lock.json` (npm) and `bun.lock` (bun) are **both tracked** — this
predates this session (both were added together in an earlier commit,
`9044d7c`). `bunfig.toml` exists, suggesting bun is the "intended" package
manager, but the Friendship Card session used `npm install`/`npm uninstall`
(for `@google/model-viewer`) and only `package-lock.json` picked that up.

**This drift is exactly what broke the Cloudflare deploy** (a later
session): Cloudflare's build detects bun (via `bunfig.toml`/`bun.lock`) and
runs `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, which hard-fails — "lockfile had
changes, but lockfile is frozen" — the moment `bun.lock` doesn't exactly
match `package.json`. `bun.lock` turned out to be missing not just
`@google/model-viewer` but `sharp` too (the `scripts/optimize-media.mjs`
devDependency, §7) and was stale enough that a straight `bun install`
(bun 1.4.0 locally vs Cloudflare's bun 1.2.15 — the text lockfile format has
been stable since 1.2, so this didn't matter) also dropped a `tsx`/`esbuild`/
`rollup` subtree that only `package-lock.json`'s npm resolver had pulled in
as optional deps bun correctly skips — confirmed harmless by running a full
`bun run build` against the regenerated lockfile, which succeeded and
produced the same `.output/server` shape as the npm build.

**Going forward: if you add/remove a dependency, run *both* `npm install`
and `bun install` after editing `package.json`**, or `bun install
--frozen-lockfile` will eventually break the Cloudflare build again — no
tooling here enforces the two lockfiles stay in sync, so this is a
by-hand discipline, not something you can trust to just work.

### 9.2 Pervasive CRLF line endings

Much of the pre-existing codebase (this session's new files are LF-only) has
CRLF line endings, because `git config core.autocrlf` is `true` on the
Windows dev machine this was built on — Git silently converts LF→CRLF on
checkout. Running `npx eslint <file>` on almost any pre-existing file will
report hundreds of `prettier/prettier: Delete '␍'` errors. **This is not a
real defect and not something introduced by any single change** — it's an
environment artifact. `npm run lint` / `npm run format` across the whole
repo will surface ~10,000 such errors; don't mass-fix them in an unrelated
PR (huge, noisy diff) unless the user explicitly asks for a line-ending
normalization pass (ideally via a `.gitattributes` `* text=auto eol=lf` rule
plus a one-time re-normalization commit, not ad hoc `--fix` runs).

### 9.3 `npm run lint` / `npm run format` and `public/vendor/`

`public/vendor/model-viewer.min.js` is a **1MB pre-minified third-party
build**, not source code. Both are configured to skip it
(`eslint.config.js`'s `ignores` array includes `"public/vendor"`;
`.prettierignore` includes `public/vendor`) — **verify this is still true**
before running either tool broadly if you ever restructure those configs;
without the exclusion, `eslint .` hangs/times out trying to parse it, and
`prettier --write .` will expand it back toward its unminified form in
place, defeating the point of vendoring a minified build. `.gitattributes`
additionally marks `public/vendor/*.js` as `binary` so Git never rewrites
its line endings across machines.

### 9.4 The `<model-viewer>` 3D component — SSR-safety pattern

This is the most structurally unusual piece of the codebase and worth
understanding fully before touching `friendship-section.tsx` or adding
another 3D/browser-only widget.

**The problem:** `@google/model-viewer` is a ~1MB browser-only library
(registers a custom element via `customElements.define`, needs WebGL). A
naive `import("@google/model-viewer")` — even inside a `useEffect`, which
never runs during SSR — still got **statically pulled into the Cloudflare
Worker's server bundle** by Vite/Nitro's build graph analysis (bundlers
include dynamic-`import()` targets in every build target that can reach
them, regardless of whether that code path is actually reachable at
runtime in that target). This was measured directly: it inflated
`.output/server` from **1.5MB to 3.7MB** for code that would never execute
server-side. An attempt to fix this via Vite's `ssr.external` config had no
effect — Nitro's own Cloudflare-preset build pass appears to re-bundle
regardless (and the `@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config` wrapper doesn't
expose a knob into that pass — see §2.1).

**The fix that worked:** don't import the package as a JS module at all.
1. `@google/model-viewer` is a **devDependency only** — nothing in `src/`
   imports it. It exists purely to pin/update the vendored file's source
   version.
2. Its self-contained prebuilt bundle
   (`node_modules/@google/model-viewer/dist/model-viewer.min.js` — the
   plain, non-"-module" variant, which bundles Three.js internally and has
   **zero external `import` statements**, unlike the `-module` variant
   which still does `import {...} from "three"`) is copied byte-for-byte
   to `public/vendor/model-viewer.min.js`, with its trailing
   `//# sourceMappingURL=...` comment stripped (no matching `.map` is
   shipped, so leaving it in place just causes a harmless-but-noisy 404).
3. `friendship-section.tsx`'s `loadModelViewer()` loads it at **runtime**
   via `document.createElement("script"); script.type = "module"; script.src
   = "/vendor/model-viewer.min.js"` appended to `<head>` — a plain HTTP
   fetch of a static asset, completely outside Vite's JS module graph. This
   can never be pulled into any bundle, client or server.
4. Loading is further gated behind an `IntersectionObserver` (300px root
   margin) on the viewer's container, so the ~1MB file only downloads once
   the Friendship Card section actually scrolls near the viewport — not on
   every page load regardless of whether the visitor ever scrolls that far.
5. A module-level `modelViewerLoad` promise singleton + a
   `customElements.get("model-viewer")` check ensure the script tag is
   injected at most once even with multiple `<FriendshipModelViewer>`
   instances mounted (the main section + its "View" modal both use it).

**To update the vendored file** (e.g. after bumping the
`@google/model-viewer` devDependency): re-copy
`node_modules/@google/model-viewer/dist/model-viewer.min.js` to
`public/vendor/model-viewer.min.js` and re-strip the sourcemap comment.
There's no build step that does this automatically — it's a manual
step, same spirit as `scripts/optimize-media.mjs`.

**TypeScript for the custom element:** `src/types/model-viewer.d.ts`
augments `declare module "react" { namespace JSX { interface
IntrinsicElements { "model-viewer": {...} } } }`. **Not** `declare global {
namespace JSX {...} }`— with React 19's automatic JSX runtime
(`"jsx": "react-jsx"` in `tsconfig.json`), TypeScript resolves
`JSX.IntrinsicElements` from `react/jsx-runtime`'s re-exported `JSX`
namespace, not the classic global one. Augmenting the wrong namespace fails
silently with a confusing "Property 'model-viewer' does not exist" error —
if you add another custom element, augment `"react"`, not `global`.

React 19 passes hyphenated JSX props straight through to custom elements as
DOM attributes (this is why `<model-viewer auto-rotate camera-controls
src="...">` works with plain kebab-case JSX attribute names, no
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`-style workaround needed).

**Rotation is driven manually, not via `auto-rotate` (§11a).** model-viewer's
built-in `auto-rotate` only orbits the *camera* around the model's Y axis
(a turntable) — there's no attribute for spinning the model on another axis.
The card is meant to spin in the screen plane (Z axis) rather than tumble
front-to-back (Y axis), so `FriendshipModelViewer` instead runs a
`requestAnimationFrame` loop that writes the `orientation` attribute
directly (`orientation="0deg 0deg <angle>deg"`), leaving `camera-controls`
untouched so drag-to-rotate still works. Which axis actually *reads* as
in-plane depends on the GLB's own local axis convention — untestable in this
sandbox (§9.5) — so the axis is a single named constant, `ROTATION_AXIS`, at
the top of `friendship-section.tsx`. **If a model swap makes the spin look
like tumbling instead of twirling, change that one constant** to `"x"` or
`"y"` rather than rewriting the animation loop.

**The GLB model itself is a placeholder.** No real product photography/scan
exists yet. `public/media/friendship/friendship-card-placeholder.glb` is a
hand-built glTF binary (~2.2KB) — a simple two-primitive box (cream front/back
faces, rose-wine-colored edge faces, no textures) constructed directly at
the byte level (no 3D authoring tool was used) and validated by loading it
through Three.js's actual `GLTFLoader`. See `Website_GUIDE/MEDIA.md` §2e for
how to swap it — same "same filename, no code change" convention as every
other media asset.

### 9.5 `wrangler dev` / `vite preview` don't work from this checkout as-is

Both were attempted for local smoke-testing during this session and failed:
- `vite dev` fails outright in some sandboxed Windows environments due to a
  native binary (`@oxc-parser`'s `.node` addon) being blocked by an
  Application Control / AppLocker policy — **this is a host-machine policy
  issue, not a project bug.** It should work fine on an unrestricted machine.
- `npx vite preview` fails because it expects a different build layout
  (`dist/server/server.js`) than what the `cloudflare-module` Nitro preset
  actually produces (`.output/server/index.mjs` + a generated
  `wrangler.json`) — `vite preview` is not the right tool for this preset;
  use `wrangler dev` (from `.output/server`, after a build) or a real
  deploy instead.
- `wrangler dev` (run from `.output/server`, per the generated
  `wrangler.json`) fails with **"Found both a user configuration file at
  wrangler.json and a deploy configuration file at
  ../../.wrangler/deploy/config.json. ... these do not share the same base
  path"** — a real conflict between the repo-root `.wrangler/deploy/`
  directory (generated by the Lovable/Nitro build tooling) and the
  per-build `wrangler.json` nested inside `.output/server/`. **Unresolved
  as of this writing.** Deleting `.wrangler/deploy/` before running
  `wrangler dev` did not fix it (it regenerates on the next build). This
  needs investigation before local `wrangler dev` iteration is usable —
  see §10.4 for what this means for actual deployment (deployment itself
  is a different, likely-unaffected code path from local `dev`).

**Practical implication:** no UI change in this codebase has been visually
verified in a live browser during recent sessions — only via `tsc
--noEmit`, `vite build` (which *does* succeed cleanly), targeted
`eslint`, and manual code tracing / isolated Node scripts replicating
specific logic (e.g. the invoice line-building function was verified by
copy-pasting its algorithm into a standalone `.mjs` script and inspecting
output, not by generating a real order). **Whoever picks this up next
should do a real browser pass** — ideally after resolving §9.5, or by
testing directly against an actual Cloudflare deployment (§10).

### 9.6 `prefer-const` lint warning in `store.ts`

`store.ts:356` (`selectCombo`) declares `let selectedTemplateIds: string[] =
[];` that's never reassigned — pre-existing, harmless, not introduced by
recent work. Low priority; a one-line fix if you're ever in that function
for another reason.

### 9.7 `npm audit` findings

4 high-severity advisories as of this session, **all pre-existing,
build-toolchain-only** (transitive deps of `eslint`/`vite`/`postcss` —
`brace-expansion`, `js-yaml`, `nanoid`, `postcss`), **not introduced by
adding `@google/model-viewer`** (verified: it has zero npm dependencies of
its own). None affect the shipped runtime bundle. Worth an `npm audit fix`
pass at some point, but out of scope for feature work unless asked.

## 10. Deploying to Cloudflare

### 10.1 Current state: live on Cloudflare Workers

The site is **now live on Cloudflare Workers** at `thelayout.layoutt.workers.dev`
(migrated 2026-08-26; Vercel was the previous host and its deployment is
being decommissioned). `SITE.links.customerReviews` in `site-content.ts`
was updated accordingly, from `https://thelayout.vercel.app/happy-customers`
to `https://thelayout.layoutt.workers.dev/happy-customers`. No custom
domain is wired up yet — it's on the bare `*.workers.dev` subdomain (see
§10.3's suggestion to add one later). The build tooling already **defaults
to Cloudflare** — Nitro's `cloudflare-module` preset is the wrapper's
default target whenever Nitro runs (see §2.1) — so the app was built
Cloudflare-ready well before the actual cutover happened. No `wrangler.toml`
is committed; Nitro generates a fresh `wrangler.json` inside
`.output/server/` on every build.

### 10.2 What Nitro's `cloudflare-module` preset produces

A `npm run build` (`vite build`) does three passes (client, SSR, and a
Nitro-specific pass) and produces:

```
.output/
  public/                    Static assets — copy of public/ plus client JS/CSS chunks (Cloudflare "Assets")
  server/
    index.mjs                 The Worker entry — exports `{ fetch(cfRequest, env, context) }`
    wrangler.json              Generated deploy config (worker name, compat flags, asset binding)
    _libs/, _ssr/, _chunks/    The actual server-side JS, code-split
```

`.output/server/wrangler.json` (as generated by this build):
```json
{
  "compatibility_date": "<today's date>",
  "main": "index.mjs",
  "assets": { "binding": "ASSETS", "directory": "..\\public" },
  "name": "ayushjadhavwork-ui-layout-revamp",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
  "no_bundle": true,
  "rules": [{ "type": "ESModule", "globs": ["**/*.mjs", "**/*.js"] }]
}
```
`name` is auto-derived from the **git remote** (`ayushjadhavwork-ui/layout-revamp`
→ `ayushjadhavwork-ui-layout-revamp`), not from `package.json`'s `name`
field (which is still the generic scaffold value `"tanstack_start_ts"` —
harmless, just don't expect it to match the worker name). This means: **if
you rename the GitHub repo or fork it, the auto-generated worker name
changes too**, which could silently create a *second* Worker instead of
updating the existing deployment. Pin an explicit `name` if that matters to
you (see §10.3).

`assets.binding: ASSETS` + the Worker's `fetch` handler checking
`isPublicAssetURL(url.pathname)` and delegating to `env.ASSETS.fetch(...)`
is Cloudflare's newer unified **Workers Static Assets** feature (distinct
from, and the modern replacement for, both classic "Workers Sites" and
"Cloudflare Pages") — static files are served directly by Cloudflare's edge
without invoking your Worker's SSR code at all, and only actual route
requests hit the Worker/SSR path.

### 10.3 How to actually deploy

You need: a Cloudflare account, and the `wrangler` CLI (already resolvable
via `npx wrangler` — no global install needed; a fresh `npx wrangler`
install happened automatically mid-session and pulled `wrangler@4.125.0`).

```bash
npm run build                 # produces .output/server + .output/public
cd .output/server
npx wrangler login            # first time only — opens a browser OAuth flow
npx wrangler deploy           # ships it
```

Nitro's own build output also prints `npx nitro deploy --prebuilt` as an
alternative — that's a Nitro-native wrapper around essentially the same
`wrangler deploy` call; either should work, but this session only verified
the plain `wrangler deploy` path exists as an option (§9.5 documents that
`wrangler dev` itself is currently broken in this checkout — deploy is a
different code path and wasn't tested end-to-end due to no Cloudflare
account being available in this session).

**Recommended before your first real deploy:**
- Decide on and pin an explicit `name` in a checked-in Nitro/wrangler
  config (via the wrapper's `nitro: { preset: "cloudflare-module", ... }`
  option — see the narrow type surface in §2.1) rather than relying on the
  git-remote-derived auto name, so renaming the repo can never orphan or
  duplicate the deployment.
- Set up a **custom domain** in the Cloudflare dashboard (Workers & Pages →
  your worker → Settings → Domains & Routes) once you have one you want to
  point here — a bare `*.workers.dev` subdomain works out of the box with
  zero extra config for testing.
- Resolve the `wrangler dev`/config-conflict issue (§9.5) first if you want
  to iterate locally against the Cloudflare runtime before each deploy,
  rather than deploying blind.

### 10.4 Difficulties you're likely to hit, given the current scope

1. **The `wrangler dev` config conflict (§9.5) will probably also affect
   any local pre-deploy verification step.** If your workflow is "test
   locally with wrangler, then deploy," budget time to debug this first —
   it wasn't resolved in this session. `wrangler deploy` itself was not
   confirmed to hit the same issue (it wasn't tested, for lack of a
   Cloudflare account in this sandboxed environment) but investigate this
   before assuming a smooth first deploy.

2. **Two lockfiles, unclear CI intent (§9.1).** If deployment is automated
   (GitHub Actions, Cloudflare's Git integration, etc.), make sure whatever
   runs `npm install`/`bun install` matches whichever lockfile is actually
   current — a CI that picks the wrong one could install stale/mismatched
   dependency versions.

3. **`public/` is 41MB across 152 files** (measured this session), the
   largest single file being `showreel.mp4` at 11MB. This is comfortably
   under Cloudflare's published Workers Static Assets per-file and
   file-count limits as of when this was checked — but **confirm current
   limits on Cloudflare's docs at deploy time**, since platform limits do
   change, and if more large video/GLB assets get added later (e.g. a real
   Friendship Card scan replacing the 2.2KB placeholder — a real photogrammetry
   scan or CAD export could easily be 5–50MB) it's worth checking again.

4. **No environment variables or Cloudflare secrets are currently needed**
   — verified by grepping `src/` for `process.env`/`import.meta.env` usage
   beyond `import.meta.env.DEV` (a build-time-only dev/prod branch, not a
   runtime secret). `CONFIG.GAS_URL` and every other config value is a
   plain hardcoded constant in `catalog.ts`, baked in at build time. This
   simplifies deployment (nothing to configure in the Cloudflare dashboard
   for the app to function) but also means **the Apps Script backend URL
   is public in the client bundle** — this was already true on Vercel, so
   it's not a new exposure, just worth knowing it's unchanged.

5. **Google Apps Script CORS behavior should carry over unchanged** — the
   backend worked from the old Vercel origin without any origin-allowlisting
   on the Apps Script side (Web Apps deployed with "Anyone" access don't
   enforce CORS restrictively, and `gas.ts`'s `text/plain` trick avoids
   preflight entirely — see §6.1), and moving the frontend's origin to
   `thelayout.layoutt.workers.dev` required no Apps Script-side change.
   Still worth a real end-to-end order test on the new domain rather than
   assuming — this hasn't been independently confirmed in this session.

6. **`nodejs_compat` is already enabled** in the generated `wrangler.json`,
   and a grep across `src/` found no Node built-in imports (`node:fs`,
   `node:path`, etc.) in application code — so the SSR bundle shouldn't hit
   any Workers-runtime incompatibilities on that front. **The one thing to
   never do:** import `sharp` (the native image-processing library used
   only by the offline `scripts/optimize-media.mjs`) from anything that
   could end up in the server bundle — native `.node` addons cannot run in
   the Workers V8-isolate runtime at all, unlike a Node.js/Vercel server.
   It's correctly a `devDependency` today and nothing in `src/` imports it
   — keep it that way. If a future feature wants server-side image
   processing, it needs a different approach (e.g. Cloudflare Images, an
   external service, or WASM-based processing) — not `sharp`.

7. **The Worker script itself is comfortably small** — measured this
   session at **1.5MB** raw (`.output/server`, no minification breakdown
   done further) after the `@google/model-viewer` vendoring fix (§9.4)
   avoided what would otherwise have been 3.7MB. This is well within
   Cloudflare's Workers script-size limits on any plan as of this check —
   but re-verify current limits if the server bundle grows substantially
   (e.g. from adding another heavy browser-only library without applying
   the same vendoring pattern).

8. **`_headers` support**: Nitro logs "Adding Nitro fallback to `_headers`
   to handle all unmatched routes" and generates `.output/public/_headers`
   from the committed `public/_headers`. Cloudflare's Workers Static Assets
   honors `_headers`/`_redirects` files the same way Cloudflare Pages
   always has, so the existing long-cache-immutable rules for
   `/media/*`, `/vendor/*`, etc. should apply unchanged — this wasn't
   independently verified against a live Cloudflare deployment in this
   session (no account available), so confirm cache headers are actually
   applied correctly on the first real deploy (check response headers on a
   media file in production).

### 10.5 Post-deploy verification checklist

Steps 1–2 are done — the site is deployed and live at
`thelayout.layoutt.workers.dev`, and the Vercel deployment is being deleted
since it's no longer needed. Steps 3–6 have **not** been confirmed in any
session so far and are still worth working through:
1. ~~`npm run build`, confirm no errors.~~ Done.
2. ~~`cd .output/server && npx wrangler deploy` (accept the `*.workers.dev`
   URL it gives you — don't wire a custom domain yet).~~ Done.
3. Load the deployed URL — confirm the homepage renders (SSR working),
   confirm images/video/fonts load (static assets working), confirm the
   cart/checkout flow works end-to-end including a real Apps Script call
   (coupon validation is the cheapest thing to test first — it's a GET, no
   write).
4. Check response headers on a `/media/*` file — confirm
   `cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` is actually present.
5. Complete one full test order (including the payment-screenshot upload
   and `completeOrder` call) and confirm a row lands in `Completed Orders`
   with a real `invoiceUrl` (not an `ERROR:` string).
6. Optionally wire up a custom domain later (Workers & Pages → the worker →
   Settings → Domains & Routes) — the site currently runs on the bare
   `*.workers.dev` subdomain.

## 11. Recent work log (this session)

For fuller narrative context than the terse bullets below, the git log
messages themselves are accurate and descriptive — this is just an index.

- **Pocket Magazine** (commit `f9948fc`, merged `49c071b`): new standalone
  ₹250 product, strictly 6 pages, own 3-template allowance, shoppable
  alongside a normal magazine. Introduced the "two parallel magazine +
  templates systems" architecture described in §5.3. `code.gs` invoice
  change **not yet redeployed** (§6.6).
- **Friendship Card** (commit `3a8e2bb`): new standalone product, two SKUs
  (Single/Duo) with MRP-strikethrough pricing (new `mrp` field on `Product`,
  new `mrpOf()` helper in `prices.ts`), interactive auto-rotating 3D
  preview. Introduced the vendored-script SSR-safety pattern described in
  §9.4. `code.gs` invoice change **not yet redeployed** (§6.6, same
  redeploy also covers the Pocket Magazine change).
- Both features were built and verified without a working local dev server
  or browser (§9.5) — verification was `tsc --noEmit`, `vite build`,
  targeted `eslint`, and isolated Node scripts replicating specific pieces
  of logic (cart→invoice line transformation, GLB binary structure). **Real
  browser QA is still outstanding** for both features.

## 11a. Recent work log (this session — uncommitted as of this writing)

- **Pocket Magazine made multi-unit + repositioned** (§5.3, §4): a customer
  can now add several Pocket Magazines in one order, each with its own
  template picker rendered directly below the product card (instead of a
  single shared picker up in the Templates section). `store.ts` replaced
  `selectedPocketTemplateIds: string[]` with `pocketUnits:
  { uid, templateIds }[]` and added `addPocketUnit`/`removePocketUnit`;
  persisted-store `version` bumped to 2 with a `migrate()` that strips any
  pre-v2 `pocket`/`pocket-templates` cart lines (see §5.3's migration note —
  this was flagged as a real incomplete-checkout risk, not just cleanup).
  `pocket-section.tsx` and `templates-section.tsx` were both rewritten;
  their shared grid/detail-modal UI was extracted into new
  `template-picker.tsx` to avoid duplicating it. In `index.tsx`, the Pocket
  Magazine block moved from between Sizes and Templates to *after*
  Templates (`id="pocket"`), and the checkout gate's incomplete-pocket
  scroll target changed from `#templates` to the specific incomplete unit's
  `#pocket-unit-<uid>` anchor.
- **Scroll nudges added** (new `scroll-hint.tsx`, `<ScrollHint>`): shown
  under the Sizes grid once a size is picked but templates aren't yet
  complete (scrolls to `#templates`), and under each Pocket Magazine unit's
  own grid while it's incomplete (scrolls to that unit's anchor).
- **Friendship Card 3D viewer**: now spins on `ROTATION_AXIS` (Z by
  default) via a manual `orientation`-attribute rAF loop instead of
  model-viewer's Y-axis-only `auto-rotate` (see §9.4's expanded note — this
  is the one change in this session that's genuinely unverifiable without a
  real browser, per §9.5). Lighting also increased: `environment-image=
  "neutral"` + `tone-mapping="neutral"` (built-in presets, confirmed present
  in the vendored `model-viewer.min.js` by grepping for the `"neutral"`
  token before relying on it — no network fetch, so no new external
  dependency), plus higher `exposure`/`shadow-intensity`/`shadow-softness`.
- **Shipping labels** (§6.3a): `code.gs` gained
  `generateShippingLabelPdf_`/`buildShippingLabelHtml_` plus supporting
  `shippingItemLabel_`/`shippingItemSummaryHtml_`/`formatPlainINR_`
  helpers, wired into `completeOrder` alongside the existing invoice
  generation. New `shippingLabel` column in `Completed Orders`, right after
  `paymentVerified`. `shippingItemSummaryHtml_` (the category-count logic
  feeding the label's ITEM cell) was verified the same way this repo
  already verifies `code.gs` logic it can't run directly — copied into a
  standalone `.mjs` and run against synthetic carts (single item, 3 pocket
  units, a combo, delivery-only) before being pasted into `code.gs`.
- **All four changes verified via `tsc --noEmit`, targeted `eslint`, and
  `npm run build`** (all clean) — same constraint as the Pocket
  Magazine/Friendship Card session before this one: no working local dev
  server in this sandbox (§9.5), so **no real browser QA has been done for
  any of this**. Whoever picks this up next should do a full browser pass
  before shipping, and this `code.gs` needs a fresh Apps Script deployment
  (§6.6) — it now carries three undeployed changes, not two.

## 11b. Recent work log — Cloudflare cutover (2026-08-26)

- **Migrated production hosting from Vercel to Cloudflare Workers.** The
  Vercel Bun install was failing (`bun install --frozen-lockfile` rejected
  `bun.lock` as changed — root cause was a bun-version skew between what
  generated the lockfile locally and the older `bun@1.2.15` Vercel's build
  image used, and pinning `packageManager` in `package.json` did not make
  Vercel switch versions). Rather than keep chasing that, the site was
  deployed to Cloudflare Workers instead (the build was already
  Cloudflare-ready per §10.1) and now lives at
  `thelayout.layoutt.workers.dev`. The Vercel project/deployment is being
  deleted since it's no longer the live host.
- Two now-unused artifacts from the Vercel debugging (`packageManager` pin
  in `package.json`, `vercel.json`) were added then removed again in this
  same cleanup pass, once Cloudflare was confirmed as the actual host.
- `SITE.links.customerReviews` in `site-content.ts` updated from
  `https://thelayout.vercel.app/happy-customers` to
  `https://thelayout.layoutt.workers.dev/happy-customers` — grepped for any
  other hardcoded reference to the old domain across `src/`, `public/`, and
  root config files and found none.
- §10 rewritten to reflect live status; see §10.5 for what's still
  unverified post-cutover (real browser QA, cache headers, a full test
  order end-to-end on the new domain — none of this was confirmed in this
  session).

## 11c. Recent work log — Friendship Card redesign + delivery-in-checkout (2026-08-27, commit `95e32b8`)

- **Friendship Card became a two-step quantity→design product** instead of
  two directly-add-to-cart SKUs — see §5.3a for the full store-level shape.
  Pricing changed to **₹399 (1 card) / ₹499 (2 cards — saves ₹299 vs two
  Singles)** in `prices.ts` (was ₹300/₹499; MRP fields left untouched).
  4 fixed designs (`card-1`..`card-4`, "Card 01".."Card 04") live in a new
  `catalog.ts` array (`FRIENDSHIP_DESIGNS`) under a new category,
  `friendship-designs`; each quantity tier's `designLimit` (1 or 2, a new
  `Product` field) caps how many of those 4 a customer can pick.
  `friendship-section.tsx` was rewritten: Step 1 is the same
  MRP-strikethrough tier cards as before but now wired to
  `setFriendship()`; Step 2 is a new, always-2-per-row design grid (click to
  select, eye icon → `FriendshipDesignDetailModal`, a front/back
  chevron-swipe detail view — no "Randomise" button, no reviews panel,
  deliberately simpler than `template-picker.tsx`'s `TemplateGrid` since
  there are only 4 designs and no per-page-count limit logic). Reuses
  `templateHero()` from `template-picker.tsx` for the image lookup, but
  uses its own `FriendshipDesignPlaceholder` (not that file's
  `TemplatePlaceholder`, a two-page "Left | Right" magazine-spread graphic
  that reads as wrong for a single card) — see the updated §7 media bullet
  for why every thumbnail/slide also carries an explicit `onError` handler.
- **Downgrade truncates, doesn't reset** — switching Duo → Single with 2
  designs picked keeps the first-picked design and drops the second,
  rather than clearing both the way `setSize` clears templates on every
  size change. See §5.3a for the full reasoning and where this diverges
  from the Sizes/Pocket precedent.
- **Cart line folding**: the on-site `CartDrawer` now folds
  `friendship-designs` cart lines into a `Design: Card 01, Card 03`-style
  line under the parent `friendship` row (`shop.tsx`) instead of letting
  them render as their own bare rows — mirrors §6.4's invoice-folding
  pattern, applied to the frontend cart view for the first time (templates
  themselves are *not* folded in the cart drawer today, only in the
  invoice — this was a deliberate, scoped exception for Friendship Card
  designs per the request, not a broader refactor of template rendering).
- **`code.gs`**: `buildInvoiceHtml_` now prints `Design:- Card 02` (or
  `Design:- Card 01, Card 03` for Duo) under the Friendship Card invoice
  row, folded the same way pocket/normal-magazine templates already are.
  `shippingItemSummaryLines_`'s EXCLUDE map gained `"friendship-designs":
  true` — without it, each design pick would leak onto the shipping label
  as its own bogus "Card 01" line; verified with the same
  copy-into-a-standalone-`.mjs`-and-run-against-synthetic-carts method this
  repo already uses for `code.gs` logic (single-card/1-design,
  duo-card/2-design, and no-friendship-line cases). **Another undeployed
  code.gs change** — see updated §6.6 list.
- **Persisted store**: `version` bumped 2 → 3; `migrate()` now also strips
  any pre-v3 `friendship`/`friendship-designs` cart lines (same
  incomplete-checkout risk §5.3's v2 migration was written to avoid, just
  for the new parent/sub-selection pair instead of `pocketUnits`). See
  §5.3a and §5.4.
- **Delivery selection moved into the checkout popup.** `CustomerInfoModal`
  (`shop.tsx`) gained its own Standard/Express picker (using the existing
  `addItem("delivery", ...)` path) and now blocks its "Continue to payment"
  button until a delivery line exists in the cart — `handle()` also
  double-checks this server-side-style before submitting. `CartDrawer`'s
  checkout button **no longer hard-gates on delivery being pre-selected**
  (the `deliveryMissing` check and its disabled-button wiring were removed)
  since the popup is now itself a valid place to pick it; the on-page Step
  6 delivery grid still works unchanged as the other valid path. `Field`
  gained an optional `defaultValue` prop, and `CustomerInfoModal` now
  pre-fills name/phone/email/address from any already-set `customer` state
  — needed because `startCheckout()` in `index.tsx` now re-opens this
  modal (rather than skipping straight to payment) whenever delivery is
  still missing, even if customer info was already captured earlier in the
  session, and the form fields are otherwise uncontrolled/blank on every
  mount.
- **All of the above verified via `tsc --noEmit`, targeted `eslint`, and a
  clean `npm run build`** — same local-dev-server constraint as every prior
  session (§9.5): **no real browser QA has been done for any of this.**
  Whoever picks this up next should do a full browser pass — the Friendship
  Card's two-step flow and the new in-popup delivery picker are the two
  highest-value things to click through by hand — and get `code.gs`
  redeployed (§6.6).

## 11d. Recent work log — Friendship Card layout follow-up (2026-08-27, uncommitted as of this writing)

Two client-requested tweaks to the §11c redesign, made before any real
`card_0N_front/back` art existed on disk (see §7's Friendship Card designs
bullet — still true after this pass):

- **Design thumbnails now frame-fit the image instead of cropping to a
  fixed box.** The Step 2 design grid's image box previously forced every
  thumbnail into a fixed `aspect-[3/4]` box with `object-cover`, cropping
  whatever image was dropped in unless it happened to match 3:4
  pixel-for-pixel. Since the real designs' actual proportions aren't known
  yet, the `<img>` now renders at `w-full h-auto object-contain` with no
  fixed-aspect wrapper — same shape as the detail modal already used — so
  the box's own height always matches the image's real proportions exactly
  (no cropping, and no letterbox bars either, unlike a first pass at this
  that kept the fixed box and just swapped in `object-contain`, which would
  have letterboxed instead of frame-fit — caught because the user's own
  wording held the modal's frame-fits-image behavior up as the standard to
  match). A fixed-aspect box only remains on the *placeholder* branch (no
  image yet / 404'd), purely so it has some shape to render before either
  the file exists or fails to load — see §11e for that box's ratio being
  corrected once real art landed. Background changed from
  `bg-white/5` to solid `bg-white` to read cleanly as a card mat rather
  than a near-invisible tint. The design detail modal
  (`FriendshipDesignDetailModal`) needed no change — it already worked this
  way.
- **Step 1 (quantity tier) made compact and single-row on every screen
  size.** Previously `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2` (stacked on mobile,
  side-by-side from `sm:` up) with the same padding/text sizing as a normal
  product card. Now always `grid-cols-2` (mobile included) inside a
  narrower `max-w-xs sm:max-w-sm` wrapper, with smaller padding, text, and
  button sizing throughout — it's a secondary "pick 1 or 2" choice sitting
  above the more visually important design grid, so it no longer competes
  with it for space or attention.
- Also noted, not changed: at the narrowest supported width
  (`max-w-xs` ≈ 320px), "DUO CARD — BESTIE SET" is long enough that it may
  wrap to two lines while "SINGLE CARD" stays on one — CSS grid stretch
  keeps both cards the same height regardless, so it won't look broken, but
  it's worth an eyeball on a real phone.
- Verified via `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean) — same
  no-local-dev-server constraint as every session so far (§9.5); the actual
  visual result (do the now-frame-fit thumbnails look right once real art
  lands, does the compact quantity row look right at real phone widths)
  still needs a real browser pass, same outstanding item as §11c.

## 11e. Real Friendship Card design art landed (2026-08-27)

While §11d was in progress, a teammate pushed the actual 8 design images
(`git pull` picked up commits `9f44faf`/`0ecb9aa` mid-session) — the
Friendship Card designs are **no longer speculative**, and two guesses made
before any real art existed turned out wrong:

- **Filenames are uppercase**, not the lowercase `card_01_front.webp`-style
  names originally guessed: `public/media/friendship/CARD_01_FRONT.webp` /
  `CARD_01_BACK.webp` through `CARD_04_FRONT`/`CARD_04_BACK`.
  `productImages` in `site-content.ts` was updated to match by that same
  teammate — nothing to do here, just don't reintroduce lowercase paths.
- **The card is landscape, not portrait** — a "Friendship Licence" card
  (name badge, photo, "lovers since", "valid for", signature, etc. — matches
  the `CUSTOMISABLE` copy list in `friendship-section.tsx` closely), real
  size **1082×708px, ≈3:2**. All 8 files share this exact size. The
  placeholder-only `aspect-[3/4]` (portrait) box from §11d was corrected to
  `aspect-[1082/708]` in both the grid card and the detail modal's
  placeholder branches, and `FriendshipDesignPlaceholder`'s comment (which
  had called it "portrait card-shaped") was corrected — this box is cosmetic
  now (only shown on a missing/broken file) but should still match the real
  shape rather than contradict it.
- The `w-full h-auto object-contain` frame-fit approach from §11d needed
  **no change** — it was already orientation-agnostic by design, which is
  exactly why it correctly renders the real landscape art with no cropping
  now that it exists, without having had to guess the ratio right the first
  time.
- Docs corrected for the same reason: `Website_GUIDE/size.md`'s Friendship
  Card row and "by shape" quick-reference (was guessing 1050×1480 portrait
  5:7, now states the real 1082×708 ≈3:2 landscape), and
  `Website_GUIDE/MEDIA.md` §2f (was guessing lowercase filenames, now states
  the real uppercase ones and calls out the case-sensitivity risk
  explicitly, since this is exactly the class of mistake §7's "filenames
  are case-sensitive in production" warning exists for).
- Also fixed in this pass: §6.5 previously carried a stale warning claiming
  `Website_GUIDE/BACKEND_SETUP.md` §8 still said "no automatic invoice or
  PDF generation" — that had already been corrected in `BACKEND_SETUP.md`
  itself in an earlier session, just never reflected here. Re-verified §8's
  current text against `code.gs` and updated §6.5 to stop flagging an
  already-fixed problem.
- Verified via `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (clean); the actual
  images were visually inspected (via the Read tool, not a browser) to
  confirm they're real "Friendship Licence" card art and not corrupt/blank
  files. Still no real browser pass on any of this — same outstanding item
  as §11c/§11d.
